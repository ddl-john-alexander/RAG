       "{'causes': ' The shingles rash is associated with an inflammation of nerves beneath the skin.  Shingles is caused by the varicella-zoster virus — the same virus that causes chickenpox. Anyone whos had chickenpox may develop shingles. After you recover from chickenpox the virus can enter your nervous system and lie dormant for years. Eventually it may reactivate and travel along nerve pathways to your skin — producing shingles. But not everyone whos had chickenpox will develop shingles. The reason for shingles is unclear. But it may be due to lowered immunity to infections as you grow older. Shingles is more common in older adults and in people who have weakened immune systems. Varicella-zoster is part of a group of viruses called herpes viruses which includes the viruses that cause cold sores and genital herpes. Because of this shingles is also known as herpes zoster. But the virus that causes chickenpox and shingles is not the same virus responsible for cold sores or genital herpes a sexually transmitted infection. A person with shingles can pass the varicella-zoster virus to anyone who isnt immune to chickenpox. This usually occurs through direct contact with the open sores of the shingles rash. Once infected the person will develop chickenpox however not shingles. Chickenpox can be dangerous for some people. Until your shingles blisters scab over you are contagious and should avoid physical contact with anyone who hasnt yet had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine especially people with weakened immune systems pregnant women and newborns.

Although shingles can occur anywhere on your body it most often appears as a single stripe of blisters that wraps around either the left or the right side of your torso. Shingles is caused by the varicella-zoster virus — the same virus that causes chickenpox. After youve had chickenpox the virus lies inactive in nerve tissue near your spinal cord and brain. Years later the virus may reactivate as shingles. While it isnt a life-threatening condition shingles can be very painful. Vaccines can help reduce the risk of shingles while early treatment can help shorten a shingles infection and lessen the chance of complications. Book: Mayo Clinic Book of Home Remedies',\n",
       " 'riskf': 'Anyone who has ever had chickenpox can develop shingles. Most adults in the United States had chickenpox when they were children before the advent of the routine childhood vaccination that now protects against chickenpox. Factors that may increase your risk of developing shingles include:    Being older than 50. Shingles is most common in people older than 50. The risk increases with age. Some experts estimate that half the people age 80 and older will have shingles. Having certain diseases. Diseases that weaken your immune system such as HIV/AIDS and cancer can increase your risk of shingles. Undergoing cancer treatments. Radiation or chemotherapy can lower your resistance to diseases and may trigger shingles. Taking certain medications. Drugs designed to prevent rejection of transplanted organs can increase your risk of shingles — as can prolonged use of steroids such as prednisone.'}"
