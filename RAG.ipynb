This tendon is used when you walk, run, jump or push up on your toes. The structure of the tendon weakens with age, which can make it more susceptible to injury — particularly in people who may participate in sports only on the weekends or who have suddenly increased the intensity of their running programs.\" (Achilles Tendinitis Overview)\\n\\n- \"Tendinitis is an overuse injury of the tendon — the thick fibrous cords that attach muscle to bone. The condition causes pain and tenderness just outside a joint.\" (Tendinitis Overview) \\n\\n- \"Patellar tendinitis is a common overuse injury, caused by repeated stress on your patellar tendon. The stress results in tiny tears in the tendon, which your body attempts to repair.\" (Patellar Tendinitis Causes)\\n\\n- \"Tennis elbow is an overuse and muscle strain'"
