Signs and symptoms include: Seek emergency medical help if you your child or someone else youre with has a severe allergic reaction. Dont wait to see if the symptoms go away. If the person having the attack carries an epinephrine autoinjector administer it right away. Even if symptoms improve after the injection you still need to go to an emergency room to make sure symptoms dont recur even without more exposure to your allergen. This second reaction is called biphasic anaphylaxis. Make an appointment to see your doctor if you or your child has had a severe allergy attack or signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis in the past. The diagnosis and long-term management of anaphylaxis are complicated so youll probably need to see a doctor who specializes in allergies and immunology.
